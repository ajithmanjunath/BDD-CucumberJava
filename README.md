# BDD Framework - Cucumber/Java

BDD framework is built using Cucumber, Java and Maven. JUnit and TestNG are used as testing frameworks to drive and execute tests.

## Getting Started

Download and extract all the files. Import as Maven project into your respective IDE. Wait for maven dependencies to download all sources and update the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To make sure java and maven path are set in system environment variables.

```
Example:

JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_221\bin

MAVEN_HOME = C:\apache-maven-3.6.1\bin
```

## Framework capabilities

1. Modular designed using POM
2. Reusability and Scalability
3. Extension for multi browser support test execution
4. Auto-Rerun of failed test cases
5. Report generation with screenshots on failure scenarios. Can be extended to all scenarios.
6. Tests can be scripted as per needs using JUnit or TestNG 
7. No external storage of screenshots.
8. Report back up for every test execution.
9. Logging mechanism is implement using log4j.

## Running the tests

1. Maven command execution
2. Batch file execution
3. TestNG xml file execution
4. JUnit level test execution

### And coding style tests

Java code style template is used
